        <h1>Privacy Policy for FlipHQ</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>FlipHQ ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>FlipHQ is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Only when you use the Find feature to search for leads within a 12-mile radius. This data is used solely for location-based searches and is not stored on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Item Information:</strong> Data you voluntarily log (item names, categories, conditions, costs) is stored locally on your device only.</li>
            <li><strong>Search History:</strong> Cached search results are stored locally on your device for convenience.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All data is stored locally on your device using AsyncStorage. We do not operate backend servers. No data is transmitted to or stored on our servers. No user accounts or login credentials are required to use FlipHQ.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>FlipHQ uses the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google Places API:</strong> For location-based searches when you use the Find feature. Google's privacy policy applies to this service. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> For FlipBot AI features. When you chat with FlipBot, your messages are sent to OpenAI for processing. OpenAI's privacy policy applies. See <a href="https://openai.com/privacy" target="_blank">OpenAI Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not share your personal information with these services beyond what is necessary for the features to function.</p>
        
        <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Purchase transactions for token bundles are processed entirely by Apple (for iOS) or Google (for Android) through their respective payment systems. We do not collect, store, or have access to your payment information. All payment data is handled by Apple/Google in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>
        
        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete all app data at any time using the "Wipe History" feature in the app settings.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the app will delete all local data stored on your device.</li>
            <li>Since no data is stored on our servers, deletion is immediate and permanent.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>FlipHQ is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
