> **A mobile app for finding, logging, and flipping secondhand treasures.**  
> Like a metal detector, but less embarrassing in public.

## 🚀 What It Does

FlipHQ helps users:
- **Find** nearby thrift stores, garage sales, and flip-worthy spots (using the Google Places API).
- **Log** items they find, including basic details and price.
- **Track** what they’ve flipped and what they’re still hoarding.
- **Fix** broken items (well… document how broken they are).
- **FlipBot** (coming soon): an AI assistant that gives users advice about what to do with their finds.
- **Stay broke, but hopeful.**

## ✅ What’s Working

- Functional **Find screen** using Google Places API (New).
- Properly integrated API key with working fetch logic.
- Search results show in real time (when the planets align and Google approves your keywords).
- Screens render, look clean-ish, and don't crash unless you want them to.
- Project Git-tracked and cursed properly with local `.env` files.
- You can build. Sometimes. If Expo’s mood is good.

## 🔜 What’s Next (10-Step Pain Plan™)

1. **Finish and polish Find screen**
   - Improve keyword coverage and max out reliable API result fetching.
   - Filter junky store results that look like 2007 dollar stores.

2. **Overhaul Home Screen**
   - Replace “How It Works” with **FlipBot** teaser button.
   - Move onboarding flow to a real intro splash (multi-screen wizard, no Hogwarts vibes).

3. **Revamp Log Screen**
   - Expand list of categories (for flipping trash in all its forms).
   - Fix math bugs that make even calculators feel shame.

4. **Create "My Finds" Screen**
   - Shows what the user has logged, maybe even makes them feel like a hoarder.

5. **Create "Fix" Screen**
   - For users who enjoy cataloging broken items but never fixing them.

6. **Create "Flip" Screen**
   - Track flips, profits, fails, and regret (optional).

7. **Build FlipBot AI Screen**
   - GPT-4 powered assistant.
   - Capped usage to keep your app from becoming a ChatGPT clone in a trench coat.

8. **Token Usage System**
   - Smart, unified credits across both FlipBot and Find screen searches.
   - $2.99 = 50 uses. Profit margin: Yes. Fraud margin: Acceptable.

9. **Recheck Everything**
   - Polish UI. Check edge cases. Kill bugs. Cry.

10. **Prepare for App Store Launch**
    - Apple only (for now).
    - No backend (we’re winging it client-side).
    - Maybe Reddit/FB shoutouts if you want strangers to use this thing.

## 💸 Monetization Plan

- **Token system** (like arcade credits for your flip dreams)
  - First few uses free.
  - $2.99 = 50 tokens.
  - Works for both AI + Places API
  - No subscriptions. No auto-billing. Just one-time micro-hits.

## 🛑 Pause Mode

If you’re reading this and wondering *“Should I do anything now?”* — no. This is a good place to pause.

You’re not being billed. The API is muted. The repo is intact.  
Go do your mortal chores and come back when you feel like bleeding into JSX again.
